        I'm a builder at heart. Whether it's coding up backend systems, experimenting with machine learning, or spinning up infrastructure in my homelab, I get a kick out of making things that actually work — and work well. Over the past few years, I've gone deep into dev, AI, and systems design, always chasing that feeling when a rough idea turns into a real, functioning tool.
        <br />
        This space is a snapshot of what I've been hacking on — projects, thoughts, workflows, and the occasional deep-dive blog post. I care about clarity, clean systems, and pushing my skills in the right direction, whether that's through quant dev, cloud-native infra, or something entirely unexpected.
        <br />
        I'm open to internships and full-time roles. If you're building something ambitious and want someone who's thoughtful, technical, and not afraid to go deep, let's talk.
